      <h1>Hi, I’m Cesar Vilcherrez</h1>

      <p>
        I am an engineering professional focused on IoT, cloud systems, and edge technologies. 
        I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science, specializing in Internet 
        of Things, at École Polytechnique (France).
      </p>

      <p>
        I hold a B.Sc. in Electronic Engineering from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru,
        where I developed projects in embedded systems and completed my final research project
        on CubeSats. Professionally, I have worked with technology service providers, primarily
        as a Technical Sales Engineer, contributing to digital transformation initiatives 
        involving Data Centers, Cloud, and digital products. More recently, I have worked 
        on IoT and embedded solutions using NVIDIA Jetson, integrated with Microsoft Azure
        Cloud.
